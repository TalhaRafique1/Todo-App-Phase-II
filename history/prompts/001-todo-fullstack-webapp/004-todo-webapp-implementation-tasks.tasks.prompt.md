## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation tasks document for Todo Web Application. Generated 76 tasks organized into 12 phases: Setup (6), Foundational (14), 7 User Stories (20 total), Frontend Auth (7), Frontend Dashboard (12), and Polish (8). Each task follows strict format with checkbox, ID, optional [P] marker, optional [US#] label, and exact file paths. Tasks organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Implementation tasks document ready for execution
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/001-todo-fullstack-webapp/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to execute tasks via Claude Code
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks phase complete - project now has complete implementation roadmap
